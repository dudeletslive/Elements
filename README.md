#What is Elements? 

Simple. 

No really, this thing's like 4kb... 

Elements is a simple HTML file that displays common HTML elements in your project. 

#What Elements is not. 

A style guide or pattern library.

While it was inspired by both, I think of Elements as more of a checklist for making sure the basic HTML *elements* in your project have been styled. 

#How to Elements? 

I wanted to make this as simple as possible. Though if you are downloading Elements from Github, please note that you do not need the source folder if you simply want to use it.  

#Shut up! Lets just use it!

1. Open the zipped file. 
2. Navigate to the Production folder.  
3. Place the elements folder into the root of your project.
4. Open the index.html file in your favorite text editor and link up your site's main css file(s). 
5. Visit your site's /elements directory *for example mysite.com/elements*
6. Profit. 

#Make it better! 

Do you have an idea that would make Elements even better? Did I leave out a common *element* that should not have been overlooked? 

Feel to contribute! 

Elements is just as easy to hack on than it is to use. Even the source code is a simple index page with a sass file and CSS file. 

Though it does use features from both [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Susy.](http://susy.oddbird.net/)

#Credits
The first version of Elements only took a few hours of work but I hope to make improvements and add more features as I use it in my own projects.

Elements was also built with some amazing tools from people much more talented than I. 

Currently it is built using: 

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)<br>
[Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)<br>
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)<br>
[Brackets](http://brackets.io)<br>
and<br>
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)<br>

Check them out! They make my life easier!
