#What is Elements? 

Simple. 

No really, this thing's like 20kb... 

Elements is a 'living checklist' of common HTML elements for every project that hooks into your exiting CSS file(s).

The vision I have for elements is to remain simplistic. The projects I have seen scratching this itch seem to always evlove into a full blown front-end framework.

Elements is about coding it right the first time, and building pages quick without worring about unstyled elements you overlooked. 

To get a better idea, you can checkout the [Live Demo](http://jamesabels.github.io/Elements)

#What Elements is not. 

A style guide or pattern library.

While it was inspired by both, I think of Elements as more of a checklist for making sure the basic HTML *elements* in your project have been styled. 

#How to Elements? 

I wanted to make this as simple as possible though there is still some setup. 

If you just want to use Elements as is, you can ditch the sass foler, though it is great for customization. Also Elements is built on [Susy.](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and 100% ready for you to drop your own  *elements* in, and nest grids until your heart is content. 

#Shut up! Show me how to use it!

1. Open the zipped file.   
2. Place the elements folder into the root of your project.
3. Open the index.html file in your favorite text editor and link up your site's main css file(s). 
4. Visit your site's /elements directory *for example mysite.com/elements*
5. Profit. 

#Make it better! 

Do you have an idea that would make Elements even better? Did I leave out a common *element* that should not have been overlooked? 

Feel to contribute! 

Elements is just as easy to hack on than it is to use. Even the source code is a simple index page with a sass file and CSS file. 

Though it does use features from both [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Susy.](http://susy.oddbird.net/)

#Credits
The first version of Elements only took a few hours of work but I hope to make improvements and add more features as I use it in my own projects. 

You can check me out [here.](http://jamesabels.net) or @jamesabels

Elements was also built with some amazing tools from people much more talented than I. 

Currently it is built using: 

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)<br>
[Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)<br>
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)<br>
[Brackets](http://brackets.io)<br>
and<br>
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)<br>

Check them out! They make my life easier!
